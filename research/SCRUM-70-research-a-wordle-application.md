# Research: Wordle Component - GitHub Application Overview

## Why am I doing this? 
This will be an additional component that a user can interact with in addition to the trivia quiz. Since there isn't much that can be done to the trivia quiz, we decided to continue on adding games/activities that would be interactive for the user. 

## Expectations on Findings:
Expected to look at code already pre-developed and apply it to the trivia quiz application. Once the code has been found, a task would be to make a component for the wordle application that will be added to the navbar for the user to select. Nothing should be changed in the original trivia game itself, only the application should have an additional component as mentioned. 

This should also be an opportunity to find what components in the wordle application should be modified for the trivia quiz application. 

## Results and  Expectations on Application:

The [GitHub link](https://github.com/ztoben/wordle-unlimited/blob/master/src/components/Header.js) consists of the code needed to play an unlimited game of Wordle created by *Zach Toben.* 

The Wordle application will be dealt between Axel and Tim. We have decided to break the tasks into who deals with which components. For example:

**Tim**: Create and/or modify the `GameScreen.js` file (GameScreen component of the application). 

**Axel**: Create and/or modify the `Keyboard.js` file (Keyboard component of the application).

The application is simple enough to follow and build on, but there's more that could be done to the application (e.g. Refactor the components, modify the CSS to suit the trivia quiz color scheme, etc.)

## Task Reflection

Below is/are the task(s) that should reflect the research done for the application:
